## What's FHE

FHE stands for **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**. It is a form of encryption that allows computations to be carried out on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext. This technology enables data to be processed while still encrypted, preserving privacy and security.

### Key Features of FHE:
- Privacy and Security: FHE ensures that sensitive data can be processed without being exposed, thus maintaining confidentiality.
- Versatility: It supports arbitrary computation on encrypted data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- Encryption Lifecycle: Data remains encrypted throughout its entire lifecycleâ€”from storage to processing to output.
