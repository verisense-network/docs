# Lightweight Consensus Protocol for AVS

The current AVS still cannot escape from the form of a blockchain. We have recognized the limitations of the traditional blockchain programming paradigm for the development and use of decentralized applications, so the AVS service provided by Verisense requires a new consensus mechanism.

We Verisense team proposed a new lightweight consensus protocol called Monadring as a gadget running inside the Verisense node for organizing AVS.

For more details, see our [paper](https://github.com/verisense-network/papers).
