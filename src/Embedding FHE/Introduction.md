# Introduction
This chapter primarily elucidates the combination of Verisense and FHE to implement three components: 1. Auctioning of Validator stakes; 2. Role Playing of AVS; and 3. Imperfect Information Game based on DeFi.
The chapter about the basic principles of FHE introduces the current development of FHE and how it can be integrated with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Verisense Network is dedicated to provide demand-side solutions in the FHE ecosystem. In the area of FHE, it offers more effective tools for specific scenarios to achieve faster homomorphic computations and privacy-preserving computations.We later introduce the application of game theory in blockchain, and how FHE changes games of perfect information into games of imperfect information.Finally, we present the application of FHE in the Verisense Network.
