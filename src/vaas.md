## Validation-as-a-Service (VaaS)

Moreover the Verisense chain serving as a VaaS module, another important component of the Verisense Network, works as an aggregator of the restaking component (Verisense layer) of the various participating L1s to offer the natural atomic-level interoperability and superfluid value transferring via the native VRSN tokens. This will be particularly appealing to dApps deployed on multiple chains such as defi protocols (DEX - GMX on Arbitrum and Avalanche, uniswap on Polkadot and Avalanche and etc) hence looking for multichain-based AVS.

VaaS is a new concept corresponding to the popular concept of PaaS (Platform as a service) or SaaS (Software as a service).

This creates an even broader space for us to imagine how the Verisense Network will boost the security guide over the crypto industry and disrupt the current landscape.
