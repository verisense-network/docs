# Overview of Verisense

While leading restaking infrastructures like EigenLayer, Karak, and Symbiotics compete fiercely on the TVLs, the supply side of security, less attention has been given to the AVS (Active Validation Services) solution, the demand side of security. It is the demand that drives supply, not the other way around. EigenLayer recognizes this critical aspect but struggles to address it due to the absence of essential components in its underlying design, which are necessary to form a rapid and secure consensus and a fair and functional slashing mechanism.

Verisense Network seizes this market opportunity by proposing an innovative mechanism to fill the gap, addressing the AVS market's needs effectively.

Verisense is the worldâ€™s first FHE-enabled (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) VaaS (Validation-as-a-Service) network designed to plug and play with any restaking layers. Our goal is to serve AVS in variety (chain-natured, non-chain-natured, and hybrid) and onboard diversified paying AVS clients, a sector currently underserved yet ultimately critical to win the restaking
